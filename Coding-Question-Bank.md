# Questions

* How can sort a really big file optimally - Standard external merge sort algorithm. Consider the scenario if there are Duplicates, How can we do external merge sort optimally ;)
* Check if Binary Tree is a BST or not?
* Find an element in an sorted rotated array without pivot, and with pivot.
* Implement an LRU with a Trie.
* Implement a Trie optimally.
* Implement Dictionary.
* Implement a function getting Substring from String, Do it optimally. 
* Implement Strcpy function.
* Sorting an array of IP addresses.
* Implement a Stack with Push pop and Getmin optimally.
  Getmin should remove the only minimum most element from the stack optimally, rest all elements should be in stack.
* Given a, b,c ,d,...z,aa,ab,ac...az,ba,bb...un-limited sequence like this,
  given an index number you should be able to return string in that sequence and given a string return the index.
* How can sort a really big file optimally - Standard external merge sort algorithm.
  Consider the scenario if there are Duplicates, How can we do external merge sort optimally ;)
* Graph - implement Breadth First Traversal, Depth First Traversal.
* [Implement Tournament Tree.](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tournament-tree-and-binary-heap/)
